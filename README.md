# Hospitality-Domain-Project

This repository contains a business intelligence project developed for AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels in India. The project was completed as part of the Codebasics Challenge. It uses PowerBI to analyze historical hotel data and provide actionable insights to help AtliQ Grands regain market share and improve revenue in the luxury and business hotel categories.

## Project Overview

AtliQ Grands hired a third-party service provider (me) to analyze their historical data and generate insights. The dashboard created in PowerBI focuses on key metrics like revenue, occupancy rates, cancellation rates, and more to support data-driven decision-making.

I followed the Codebasics PowerBi Course while working on this project
